The Public Room View in SpreaView is a web-based display that provides a real-time schedule of sessions for a specific room during an event. It is accessible via a unique URL that includes the event code, allowing participants and organizers to quickly check the schedule for any given room. The Public Room View is designed to be clear, concise, and accessible, making it easy to see what's happening now and what's coming up next in the room.

## Accessing the Room View

To access the Public Room View for a specific room, use the following URL format:

```
https://spreaview.com/room/{event_code}
```

- **{event_code}**: This is the unique code assigned to your event. Replace `{event_code}` with the actual code provided for your event.

## Features of the Public Room View

### 1. **Current Session Display**

At the top of the Public Room View, the ongoing session is prominently displayed. This section includes:

- **Session Title**: The name of the current session.
- **Start and End Time**: The scheduled time frame for the session.
- **Speakers**: The name(s) of the speaker(s) or facilitator(s) leading the session.

This information is updated in real-time, ensuring that participants always know which session is currently in progress.

### 2. **Next Session Preview**

Directly below the current session information, the Public Room View shows details of the upcoming session. This section includes:

- **Session Title**: The name of the current session.
- **Start and End Time**: The scheduled time frame for the session.
- **Speakers**: The name(s) of the speaker(s) or facilitator(s) leading the session.

This preview helps participants plan their time and ensures they don't miss the sessions they are interested in.

### 3. **QR Code for Session Review**

When the Public Room View is accessed on a screen that is large enough (e.g., on a monitor or large tablet), a QR code is displayed on the page.

- **Session Review QR Code**: This QR code allows participants to quickly access the session review page, where they can provide feedback, rate the session, and leave comments.

The QR code feature encourages attendee engagement and helps organizers gather valuable insights from participants.

### 4. **Responsive Design**

The Public Room View is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, the layout is simplified to ensure that the most important information—the current and next sessions—is always visible. On larger screens, additional elements like the QR code are displayed to enhance functionality.

### 5. **Automatic Updates**

The information displayed in the Public Room View is automatically updated as sessions progress throughout the day. This ensures that the schedule is always accurate and up-to-date without the need for manual refreshes.

## Use Cases

- **Event Displays**: The Public Room View is perfect for use on digital displays outside event rooms, providing participants with real-time information about the sessions in that room.
- **Participant Convenience**: Attendees can easily access the room view on their personal devices using the event code, giving them quick access to the room schedule wherever they are.
- **Feedback Collection**: The built-in QR code for session reviews encourages attendees to provide immediate feedback, enhancing the overall quality of the event.

## Conclusion

The Public Room View in SpreaView is a powerful tool for keeping both organizers and participants informed about the real-time schedule of a specific event room. With features like live session displays, upcoming session previews, and easy access to session reviews, it enhances the event experience by providing crucial information at a glance.
