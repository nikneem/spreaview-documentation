description: Collecting reviews, the essential need of SpreaView
---

In SpreaView, collecting attendee feedback is a core feature designed to provide valuable insights for both speakers and event organizers. Feedback gathered from session reviews helps improve the quality of content, the effectiveness of delivery, and the overall attendee experience. One of the most efficient ways to collect reviews is by leveraging QR codes that lead directly to the session's review page, simplifying the process for attendees.

This documentation page outlines the process of collecting review information through QR codes and explains why encouraging attendee participation is critical to the success of feedback collection.

## The Review URL and QR Code

Each session in SpreaView is assigned a unique review URL that directs attendees to the review page for that specific session. The format of the URL is:

```
https://spreaview.com/review/{session_code}
```

Where `{session_code}` is a unique identifier for the session.

### Download Event QR codes

To download a ZIP file, with the QR codes of all sessions, you simply open the details of your event. On the toolbar, the button `Download QRs` enables. Click it and wait for the ZIP file to be generated (this may take a couple of seconds). Your browser will automatically download the ZIP file once generated.

### QR Code for Easy Access

To make it easier for attendees to access the review page, SpreaView generates a QR code for every session. This QR code links directly to the session's review URL and can be easily shared with attendees.

#### How to Use the QR Code:

- **Download the QR Code**: You can download the QR code for any session from the SpreaView platform.
- **Share the QR Code**: Include the QR code in your presentation slides, event materials, or any other medium where attendees can quickly scan it using their smartphones.

By scanning the QR code, attendees are immediately directed to the review page, where they can submit their feedback.

> For session reviews to be effective, it is essential that attendees are encouraged to provide their feedback. As a conference organizer or speaker, you play a critical role in motivating attendees to participate in the review process.

### Best Practices for Encouraging Reviews

1. **Highlight the Importance of Feedback**:
   - At the beginning or end of each session, speakers should emphasize the importance of receiving feedback. Let attendees know that their opinions help improve future sessions and contribute to the overall success of the event.
2. **Include the QR Code in Presentation Slides**:

   - It’s highly recommended that speakers include the session’s QR code in their presentation slides. Displaying the QR code at the end of the session provides attendees with an immediate and convenient way to submit their reviews before they leave the room.

3. **Remind Attendees to Scan the QR Code**:

   - Provide a verbal reminder to attendees to scan the QR code and leave a review as part of the session's closing remarks. If possible, dedicate a moment for them to scan the code while still in the session.

4. **Encourage Honest and Constructive Feedback**:
   - Organizers and speakers should encourage attendees to give honest, constructive feedback. Clear instructions on what kind of feedback is useful (e.g., about content, delivery, engagement) can help attendees provide more meaningful responses.

## Review Window and Submission Guidelines

### When Can Attendees Submit Reviews?

- **Review Window**: Attendees can only submit reviews within the designated review window for each session. This window typically opens shortly after the session started and remains open for a configurable period determined by the event organizer.
- **Why a Review Window?**: The review window ensures that feedback is relevant and timely, while also giving attendees an opportunity to reflect on the session before submitting their reviews.

### Categories for Review

When attendees visit the review page via the QR code or URL, they are asked to provide feedback in several categories, typically including:

- **Speaker Quality**: How well the speaker presented the material and engaged the audience.
- **Content**: The relevance, clarity, and depth of the session’s content.
- **Delivery**: The speaker’s communication style, pacing, and ability to convey the message effectively.
- **Interaction**: The level of audience interaction and engagement facilitated by the speaker.

Additionally, an optional free-text field may be available, allowing attendees to leave more detailed comments about their experience.

## Benefits of Collecting Session Reviews

### 1. **Speaker Improvement**:

- Speakers can use the feedback to enhance their presentation skills, improve the quality of their content, and engage more effectively with audiences in future sessions.

### 2. **Data-Driven Event Planning**:

- For event organizers, the reviews provide valuable insights into what topics and presentation styles resonate with the audience. This data can guide future event planning, helping to select more relevant sessions and speakers.

### 3. **Better Attendee Experience**:

- The feedback loop created by session reviews allows for continuous improvement, ensuring that future events are better aligned with attendee expectations and preferences.

## Conclusion

Collecting review information is a vital part of ensuring continuous improvement in events, and SpreaView makes it easy through the use of session-specific QR codes and review URLs. By encouraging attendees to leave feedback and making the process as simple as possible, you help speakers refine their content and organizers plan more effective events. Ensure that the QR code is prominently displayed, remind attendees of the importance of their reviews, and ensure that the review window is open at the appropriate time. By following these best practices, you can maximize the value of the feedback you collect and elevate the overall event experience.
