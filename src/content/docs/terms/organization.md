Within SpreaView, an organization serves as a container for one or more events, providing a structured environment for managing and overseeing conference activities. Organizations are essential for organizing and coordinating events, as they offer a centralized platform for collaboration, resource allocation, and event planning.

For organizers to create and manage events within SpreaView, joining at least one organization is mandatory. This affiliation ensures that organizers have the necessary framework and support to effectively plan and execute their events, leveraging the collective resources and capabilities of the organization.
