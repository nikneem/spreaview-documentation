An organizer, in the context of SpreaView, is an individual actively engaged in the planning and coordination of conferences. Organizers are essential to the success of these events, handling tasks such as scheduling, logistics, and participant management.

Within SpreaView, organizers have the capability to create or join multiple organizations to better manage and collaborate on their conference activities. However, to fully utilize SpreaView's features, it is mandatory for organizers to be affiliated with at least one organization. This ensures they have the necessary support and resources to effectively oversee their conference-related responsibilities.
