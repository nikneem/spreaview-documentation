In SpreaView, the term "Room" refers to a designated space where sessions are held during a conference, meetup, or other event. Rooms are essential components of both in-person and virtual events, as they provide the structure and organization necessary to host multiple sessions simultaneously. By managing rooms effectively, event organizers can ensure a smooth flow of sessions, whether they're happening in physical locations or virtual environments.

## What is a Room?

A "Room" in SpreaView is defined as:

- **Designated Space**: A specific area, either physical or virtual, where sessions are conducted. This could be a conference hall, a breakout room, an online meeting link, or a virtual webinar space.
- **Session Host**: Each room is assigned to host one or more sessions. The room provides a controlled environment for these sessions, ensuring that each one has a dedicated space within the event's broader schedule.

## Types of Rooms

### 1. **In-Person Rooms**

For in-person events, a room is a physical location where participants gather to attend sessions. Examples include:

- **Conference Halls**: Large spaces that can accommodate many attendees for keynote speeches or main sessions.
- **Breakout Rooms**: Smaller rooms used for workshops, panels, or more intimate sessions.
- **Classrooms or Meeting Rooms**: Spaces used for specific topics, often equipped with seating, audio-visual equipment, and other necessary facilities.

### 2. **Virtual Rooms**

For virtual events, a room is an online space where participants join remotely. These rooms are defined by their digital access points, such as:

- **Virtual Meeting Links**: URLs to video conferencing platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet, where sessions are held.
- **Webinar Platforms**: Spaces designed for hosting large online events, allowing for presentations, Q&A, and other interactions.
- **Breakout Sessions**: Smaller virtual rooms within a larger online event, often used for focused discussions or specialized content.

## Room Characteristics

### 1. **Multiple Rooms per Event**

Events in SpreaView can have multiple rooms, allowing organizers to:

- **Host Concurrent Sessions**: Multiple sessions can run simultaneously in different rooms, offering participants a variety of options to choose from.
- **Categorize by Track or Topic**: Rooms can be designated for specific tracks, themes, or topics, helping attendees find sessions that align with their interests.

### 2. **Single Room Events**

Some events may only require a single room, which simplifies the scheduling and management process. These events typically have:

- **Focused Agenda**: All sessions occur in one space, making it easy for attendees to follow the event's flow.
- **Continuous Sessions**: Sessions are scheduled one after the other in the same room, ensuring that all activities are centralized.
