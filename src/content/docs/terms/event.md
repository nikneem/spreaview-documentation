In SpreaView, the term "Event" refers to an occasion where a conference, meetup, or any other type of gathering takes place. An event serves as a central container that holds and organizes all the individual components of the occasion, including sessions, speakers, and various settings.

Key Characteristics of an Event:
Container for Sessions: An event is structured to include multiple sessions, which are specific presentations, discussions, or activities that occur within the broader event. Each session is led by one or more speakers, who present content to the attendees.

Start and End Dates: Every event in SpreaView has defined start and end dates. These dates specify the duration of the event, allowing participants and organizers to plan and manage their time effectively.

Event Settings: An event also contains configurable settings that allow organizers to customize the behavior of SpreaView for that specific event. These settings might include options for attendee management, communication preferences, and other event-specific functionalities.

Overall, an event in SpreaView is the framework that brings together all the elements necessary for a successful conference or gathering, providing a cohesive structure for managing sessions, speakers, and other critical components.
