# Session Review Documentation

## Overview

SpreaView provides a robust and user-friendly system for collecting feedback on sessions through the Session Review feature. Each session within an event has a unique, immutable review code that attendees can use to access the review page. This feature allows event organizers to gather valuable insights and feedback from participants, helping to improve the quality of future sessions.

## Accessing the Review Page

To leave a review for a session, attendees can navigate to the following URL:

```
https://spreaview.com/review/{session_code}
```

- **{session_code}**: This is the unique code assigned to the session. Replace `{session_code}` with the specific code for the session you wish to review. This code is generated upon session creation and remains constant, ensuring that it is always associated with the correct session.

## Review Submission Process

### 1. **Review Window**

The ability to submit a review is controlled by a review window, which is determined by the event organizer. Attendees can only submit their reviews during this designated time frame. If the review window is not open, the review page will display a message indicating that reviews are not currently being accepted for that session.

### 2. **Rating Categories**

When the review window is open, attendees are asked to rate the session in four key categories using a 1 to 5-star scale:

- **Speaker**: How well the speaker delivered the session, including their knowledge, clarity, and engagement.
- **Content**: The quality and relevance of the session content, including how well it met the attendeesâ€™ expectations and needs.
- **Delivery**: The overall presentation of the session, including pacing, structure, and use of visual aids.
- **Interaction**: The level of audience interaction facilitated by the speaker, including opportunities for questions, discussions, and participation.

### 3. **Optional Free Text Feedback**

In addition to the star ratings, organizers can enable an optional free text field on the review page. This field allows attendees to provide additional comments or detailed feedback about the session. This feedback can be invaluable for understanding specific aspects of the session that were particularly effective or areas that may need improvement.

### 4. **Submitting the Review**

Once attendees have completed their ratings and any optional comments, they can submit their review directly through the review page. The submission is processed immediately, and the data is stored securely within the SpreaView platform for organizer access.

## Review Analytics and Reporting

After the review window has closed, event organizers can access the collected feedback through the SpreaView dashboard. The data is presented in an organized format, allowing for easy analysis of ratings and comments. This feedback can be used to:

- Identify strengths and areas for improvement in session content and delivery.
- Evaluate speaker performance and interaction with the audience.
- Gather overall satisfaction metrics to inform future event planning.

## Use Cases

- **Immediate Feedback Collection**: Attendees can provide feedback right after a session, while the content is still fresh in their minds.
- **Speaker and Content Evaluation**: Organizers can use the collected data to assess the effectiveness of speakers and the relevance of the content, helping to curate better sessions in future events.
- **Customized Feedback Options**: The optional comment field allows organizers to gather qualitative feedback that can provide deeper insights beyond numerical ratings.

## Conclusion

The Session Review feature in SpreaView is an essential tool for gathering meaningful feedback from event participants. By offering a simple, yet comprehensive review system, SpreaView helps organizers enhance the quality of their events, ensuring that each session meets the expectations and needs of attendees.
