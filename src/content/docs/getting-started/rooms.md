In SpreaView, [rooms](/docs/terms/room/) are integral components of events, serving as the designated spaces where sessions are held. Whether an event spans multiple rooms or just a single room, SpreaView allows for flexible and efficient management of sessions within these spaces. Rooms help organize the flow of an event, making it easy to manage schedules, track session locations, and provide participants with clear information about where each session will take place.

## Structure of Rooms in SpreaView

### 1. **Rooms within Events**

Rooms are always organized under specific events in SpreaView. Each event can have:

- **Multiple Rooms**: For larger events, multiple rooms can be set up, allowing sessions to run concurrently in different locations. This is useful for conferences with several tracks or parallel sessions.
- **Single Room**: For smaller events, all sessions can be hosted in a single room. This simplifies the schedule and helps focus the event’s activities in one space.

### 2. **Room Properties**

When creating a room within an event, several key properties need to be defined:

- **Room Name**: A unique identifier or name for the room, which helps attendees and organizers easily locate and reference it.

### 3. **Sessions within Rooms**

Sessions are the core activities that take place within rooms. Each session is planned and scheduled to occur in a specific room:

- **Session Assignment**: When planning an event, organizers assign sessions to specific rooms. This assignment is crucial for scheduling and managing the event, as it dictates where each session will take place.
- **Session Timing**: Rooms must be carefully managed to avoid scheduling conflicts.
- **Room View**: The [Public Room View](/docs/additional-features/rooms/) feature allows attendees to see the schedule of sessions happening in a specific room. This view includes the current session, the next session, and any additional details like a QR code for session reviews.

## Managing Rooms in SpreaView

### 1. **Creating Rooms**

Rooms can be created during the event setup process:

- Navigate to the event management section and select the option to add a new room.
- Enter the required details, such as the room name.
- Once created, the room becomes available for session assignments.

### 2. **Assigning Sessions to Rooms**

After rooms are set up, sessions can be assigned to these rooms:

- During session creation or editing, select the appropriate room from the list of available rooms.
- Ensure that the session timing aligns with the room's availability to prevent conflicts.

## Use Cases

- **Multi-Track Conferences**: Large conferences can use multiple rooms to host parallel sessions, ensuring that participants have a variety of options to choose from.
- **Single-Track Events**: Smaller events might use just one room, simplifying the schedule and focusing all activities in one space.
- **Virtual Rooms**: For online events, rooms can represent different virtual meeting spaces, with sessions assigned accordingly.

## Conclusion

Rooms in SpreaView play a crucial role in organizing and managing events. By allowing sessions to be planned and scheduled within specific rooms, SpreaView helps streamline the event management process, making it easier for organizers to coordinate activities and for participants to find and attend sessions. Whether your event has multiple rooms or just one, SpreaView’s room management features provide the flexibility and control needed to ensure a successful event.
