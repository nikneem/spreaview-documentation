In our software system, [Speakers](/docs/terms/speaker/) refers to individuals who will be presenting or speaking at your conferences. Speakers are directly associated with the organization you are currently working under, and their registration is not tied to specific events. This allows for greater flexibility when planning and organizing your event sessions.

### Key Features of Speaker Management:

- **Organization Binding:**
  Speakers are linked to the organization you have selected in the system. This means that when you register a speaker, they are added to the complete list of speakers available under the current organization.

- **Centralized Speaker List:**
  Since speaker registrations are not bound to individual events, you can maintain a centralized list of speakers for your organization. This list can be accessed anytime you are creating or managing event sessions.

- **Selecting Speakers for Event Sessions:**
  When you create or edit event sessions, you can choose from the entire list of speakers registered under the selected organization. This eliminates the need to re-enter speaker information for each event, streamlining the event planning process.

### How to Register and Manage Speakers:

1. **Registering a New Speaker:**

   - Navigate to the Speakers section under your selected organization.
   - Click on "New Speaker" and enter the required information (e.g., name, and picture URL).
   - Save the speaker to add them to your organization's speaker list.

2. **Managing Existing Speakers:**

   - In the Speakers section, you can view the full list of registered speakers.
   - Use search and filter options to quickly find a specific speaker.
   - Click on a speaker's name to edit their details or update their information as needed.

3. **Assigning Speakers to Event Sessions:**
   - When setting up or editing an event session, you can select speakers from the drop-down list of all registered speakers under the active organization.
   - Simply choose the appropriate speaker(s) for the session, and their details will be automatically included.

**Note:** Always ensure you are working under the correct organization context, as the list of speakers available to you will depend on the organization selected in the upper right corner of the interface.

### External Speaker Integration

If a speaker is imported from one of the supported integration platforms, their information is locked within the system. This means that you cannot edit or update the speaker's details directly in SpreaView. Any changes to the speaker's information must be made in the external system from which they were imported. Once updated externally, the changes will be reflected in SpreaView upon synchronization.
