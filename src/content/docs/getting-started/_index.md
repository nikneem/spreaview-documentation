Welcome to SpreaView. At SpreaView, we use Auth0 as an identity provider. So to log in, you need to create an account in Auth0, or log in with either one of your existing accounts at one of the supported identity providers. At this time, only Google authentication is supported.

If you logged in for the first time, SpreaView needs you to register as an [Organizer](/docs/terms/organizer/).

Your name and email address are fetched from your identity provider and automatically filled in. Click on the Register button to register as an Organizer.
