Once you are [registred as an Organizer](/docs/getting-started/), you need an [Organization](/docs/terms/organization/) to work with. If you received an invitation, you can use the invitation code to join an existing Organization. Alternatively, you can create your own organization.

To create an organization, navigate to the 'Organizations' tab in the main menu. Click on the 'Create an Organization' button to create a new Organization.
Note that this button may appear as a '+' on screens with a smaller resolution.

Once saved, the new organization will appear in the list of organizations.

## Organization details

If you click on the name of one of your organizations, you will open its details. Here, you can change the name of the organization, but also invite others to join your organization.

## Working Under an Organizational Context

In our software system, it is mandatory for all users, specifically organizers, to operate within the context of an organization. This ensures that all actions, events, and tasks are correctly associated with the appropriate organizational entity.

### Single Organization Membership

If you are an organizer who belongs to only one organization, the system automatically sets you to work under the context of that organization. You will not need to manually select an organization, and all your activities will be associated with this default organization.

### Multiple Organization Memberships

For organizers who are members of multiple organizations, a drop-down menu will appear in the upper right corner of your interface. This drop-down allows you to select which organization you are currently working under. The selected organization becomes the "active" organization, and all your actions will be linked to this chosen context.

#### How to Select an Organization:

1. Locate the drop-down box in the upper right corner of your screen.
2. Click on the drop-down box to view a list of all organizations you are a member of.
3. Select the organization you wish to work under.
4. The interface will update to reflect your choice, and you can now proceed with your tasks within the context of the selected organization.

**Important:** Always ensure you have the correct organization selected before performing any actions, as all tasks, events, and data entries will be tied to the active organization.
